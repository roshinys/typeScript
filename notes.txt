1. typescript adds strict types to be used in js 
    ex function add(n,m){
        return n+m
    }
    here add(1,2) returns 3
    whereas add("1",2) returns 12 
    type script actually helps us in strict type

2.adds next gen features to old browsers which cannot be used normally,adds decorators which is a meta programming feature,non next gen features some features which doesnt exist in js ,has rich configuration options helps in how code is compiled

//495-496
1.typescript : browsers dont understand the ts it only understands js so we need a compiler
2.when  we compile it creates a js file where it converst ts code to js code in the new file
4. number ,object,array ,boolean etc
5.we have specifically defined the type of num to be taken as param or args so it throws error

//497-499
1. typescript can understand what types the element is smartly, you dont have to explicitly tell it
    ex when you get const nElement = document.getElementById("n"); it understands nElement as HTMLElement 
2.when you select a input element based on id ts has no way to know it as a value so you need to typecast it which solves the problem
3.tsc init helps us to set some configuration
4.strict mode certain things are not allowed which is meant to be allowed to check if it is null
5. the statement ignores the null value when we know its already exist
6. any means it can have any type so its not a good use

//500-502
1.HTMLElement area actually dom objects,to handle type of objects we use ex = >{val:number,timestamp:Date}
2.here for array ex => const nums:number[] = []
4. type allows to have its own type alias ex type numorstr = number | string now numorstr can be used anywhere
5. it also allows to use define structure or type of data structures , interfaces can also be used to force classes and certain methods so it is used heavily
6.generic which interacts with other type as array is outer type elements in array is number type ex Array<number>
7. cos we cant use promises async await functionality 
8. promise either resolves or rejects a value which is generic type
